#  Batch CTRL-C, CTRL-V

This script is here to make your life much easier when it comes to CTRL-C, CTRL-Ving large amounts of text files. Written in Python.

## Installation

To use this script, you will need to have Python 3.x installed. No additional libraries are required.

## Usage
** :warning: :warning: The script overwrites the existing file, so it is recommended to backup the files before using this script.**
1. Run the script and enter the path to the folder containing the files you wish to paste to.
2. Enter the file extension of the files you wish to modify, or leave it blank if you want to edit every file in the folder.
3. Type or paste in the new text you want to replace the old text with. **Type "please stop 837" (without quotes) to save the new text.**
4. The script will then prompt you to confirm that you want to replace the contents of the files. Type "y" to confirm, or "n" to cancel.
5. The script will then do its magic and modify the specified files. It will also let you know if there were any issues.
6. Press "Enter" to exit the script.

**Notes:**
- As the script overwrites the existing file, it is recommended to backup files before using this script.
- This script is intended for use on plain text files, and may not work correctly on other file types.
- The script only modifies files in the folder specified, and will not modify subfolders or files in subfolders.
- This is my first time making an actually useful functioning python program, so please take it easy on me.
